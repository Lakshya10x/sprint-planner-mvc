<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-security -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.0</version>
</dependency>

Note :- If still you can see error, then make a small change in pom.xml and rerun the application.

After adding above dependency, all the URL's are protected.
Username - user
Password - System generated console log password (Using generated security password: 544e27a9-b4c4-4b45-9e65-e8cb9745c900)
